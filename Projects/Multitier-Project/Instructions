Objective:
Build a simple web application that allows users to participate in a poll by entering their name and selecting their favorite animal (either a dog or a cat). The submitted data should be stored in a MySQL database hosted on Amazon RDS. Additionally, provide an acknowledgment message to users after they submit their response.

Deployment:

Deploy the frontend and backend code to separate servers if possible. Ensure they can communicate.
Add index.html in front-end and application.js in back-end
Create a MySQL database in Amazon RDS and configure it for connecting it from the backend instance.

MYSQL Settings:
If your doing in local ,

MySQL Configuration:

In the MySQL configuration file (usually located at /etc/mysql/my.cnf or /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf), make sure that the MySQL server is configured to bind to the IP address that is accessible from your host machine. You may need to set the bind-address to the IP address of the virtual machine or use 0.0.0.0 to bind to all available network interfaces.
Example:

bind-address = 0.0.0.0

CREATING A DATABASE FOR APPLICATION :

CREATE DATABASE poll_db;

USE poll_db; -- Switch to the poll_db database

CREATE TABLE poll (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    animal VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
);

CONFIGURING IT TO APPLICATION SERVER:
const pool = mysql.createPool({
    host: 'your-rds-endpoint',       // Replace with your RDS instance endpoint
    user: 'your-rds-username',      // Replace with your RDS master username
    password: 'your-rds-password',  // Replace with your RDS master password
    database: 'your-database-name', // Replace with your database name (e.g., poll_db)
});

Connecting RDS from your MySQL Client:

mysql -h your-rds-endpoint -u your-rds-username -p


Testing:

Test your web application to ensure it functions correctly:
Enter various names and favorite animals into the form.
Verify that the data is successfully recorded in the database.
IF EVERYTHING IS CONFIGURED CORRECTLY YOU CAN SEE YOUR ENTRY IN THE DATABASE!!!
